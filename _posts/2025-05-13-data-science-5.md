Recently, there have been many tips on *how to use ChatGPT effectively* on the Internet. This skill is called **Prompt Engineering**. Some people are very good at using ChatGPT, but in the case of people who are not familiar with IT or have little experience, the quality of AI response may be **limited by their ability to write immediately**.

Currently, core AI engines are highly developed, but the interface is still in its early stages. This situation is similar to the early Internet era when people used **terminals to access PC communication**. AI itself is making rapid progress, but the way we interact with AI is still catching up.



## Improving AI Interfaces with XR

**XR (Extended Reality)** is considered one of the **advanced AI interface** solutions. Like the movie "Iron Man," in which robots can analyze the visual environment and make decisions instantly, **XR can help AI become more efficient and responsive**.

For example, ChatGPT already supports images, and Google's Gemini can translate menu boards in real time. If these functions are provided through seamless devices such as headsets like Vision Pro, **the usability of AI will greatly improve and the XR market will grow rapidly**.

Meta is offering a service that allows AR glasses to take pictures of the surrounding area with cameras to help users find lost items. For example, if a key is lost, the AR glasses will tell you when and where the key was last placed and show you where it was. This is a great example of how to integrate AI into XR.

Overall, as XR and AI continue to evolve, the way we interact with technology will become more natural and intuitive, creating new possibilities for personal and professional use.
